# Solid-Bootstrap-Core

`Solid-Bootstrap-Core` is a port of `@restart/ui` (formally `react-overlays` and a core dependancy of `React-Bootstrap`).

A set of full featured, extensible, and accessible UI components, designed to integrate into any styling
framework or system. These components, are "headless", meaning they don't provide any styles. Components encapsulate
the complicated logic and and state without being prescriptive about their look and feel.

See the [Core section of the Solid-Bootstrap documentation](https://solid-libs.github.io/solid-bootstrap/#/core/overview) for examples.
